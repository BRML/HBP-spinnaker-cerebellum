Data Spec Executor (Host-based)
-------------------------------

The Spec Executor is a generic (i.e. application-independent) module
that takes a list of Data Specs (one-per-core) and parses them, generating
files that must be loaded to the machie ready for simulation.

The Specs were previously generated by the Data Spec Generator, which itself
calls an application specific module that does the actual work of deciding
what must be built for each node.
