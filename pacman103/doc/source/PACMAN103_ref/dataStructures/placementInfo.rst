Placement Objects
-----------------

During the Place process, computing tasks represented by subvertices are 
assigned to a particular core on the target SpiNNaker machine. This 
association between task and core is captured by a *Placement* object.

=================== ===================
  Field                   Value
=================== ===================
  Defined in           lib/lib_map
  Class name           Placement
  Generated by         Mapper
  Used by              Data Spec Generator
=================== ===================

An instance of the *Placement* class has the following child elements:

=================== ====================== ========================= 
  Element                 Type              Notes
=================== ====================== ========================= 
  subvertex           Ref. to subvertex     This is the task being allocated
  processor           Ref. to processor     This is the allocated processor
=================== ====================== ========================= 

A *Placement* object is copied to the *placement* field of the subvertex.
