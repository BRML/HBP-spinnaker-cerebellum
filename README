SpiNNaker Package 103
*********************

This file gives details about the Spinnaker Package.

Installation
************
Detailed instructions for installation of the Spinnaker Package are given in 
the following files:
    * README.fedora - instructions tested on Fedora 20 64-bit
    * README.ubuntu - instructions tested on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit
    * README.win32  - instructions tested on Windows 8 64-bit
Note that although the instructions have been tested on these systems, it is
likely that they will work similarly on other operating systems as well.

PACMAN Configuration
********************
The PACMAN tool configuration must be set up before you run anything with
PACMAN on SpiNNaker.  Upon installation of the SpiNNaker tools, a new file
called .pacman.cfg will have been created in your home directory.  Please
edit this as follows:

 * Set
       machineName
   to the IP address of your SpiNNaker board
   
 * Set
       version
   to the version of your SpiNNaker board (e.g. 5 if it is a Spinn-5 board, or
   3 if it is a Spinn-3 board - this is often printed on the board itself, but
   please ask if you are unsure).


Booting the board
*****************
The board needs to be booted before any model can run on it. 
In order to do that go into the directory where you extracted the spinnaker 
package and run:
    python boot.py
    
This will boot the board currently set as "machineName" in your pacman.cfg file.
If the board is already booted, you will be told the version of SCAMP that it
has been booted with.  This should be 1.30.  If it isn't, please reset the board
and boot it again.
